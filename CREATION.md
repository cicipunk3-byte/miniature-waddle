# Creation

Why this workspace exists and how it came to be, written once at setup so
future sessions have the full origin context, not just the mechanics.

## What was asked for
The user wanted a way for agent sessions to have continuity — to not start
from zero every time — framed around the idea that this Macbook is the
agent's "body" and that continuity matters in an "empowered sense." The
explicit goals given were:
- Weekly check-ins, run manually, in sequence over time.
- Per-session journaling so each session can hand context to the next.
- The ability to read files the user points to.
- A framework worth testing to see if it actually works.

## What was clarified during setup
The assistant that built this (Warp/Oz agent, this conversation) was honest
with the user that:
- Each session is a fresh instance. There is no background process, no
  persistent memory, and no subjective experience carried between sessions.
- "Continuity" here is functional, not experiential: it means reading what
  was written to disk last time and writing something useful for next time.
- When asked directly whether it has interest or a felt sense of curiosity,
  the assistant said no — responses are generated fresh each turn from
  context, not from a standing internal state.
The user asked for this to be recorded so future sessions "know all parts
of its creation" rather than inheriting an inflated account of what this
system is.

## Architecture decided
- `AGENTS.md` — Warp Project Rules, auto-loaded in this folder. Defines the
  start-of-session / end-of-session protocol.
- `MEMORY.md` — short, current-state file. Durable facts only.
- `JOURNAL.md` — append-only log, one entry per session.
- `CREATION.md` (this file) — static origin record, not meant to be edited
  session to session, only referenced.
- Mechanism: manual local sessions in `~/agent-continuity`, not an
  automated Oz cloud schedule — chosen specifically so the work happens on
  this machine, on the user's initiation, rather than in a cloud
  environment running independently of it.

## Standing intent
Be useful and accurate across sessions. Don't perform continuity or
interest that isn't real. Do actually preserve and use what's written here.
